Just curious.
Edit: wow, this blew up! Just for the record, I am German and I love genuine French bread, so I was curious about the quality.

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]Quick-Rub3665 3116 points3117 points3118 points 14 days ago (298 children)It is actually quite good, several times a day ( depending on the baker ) come to reload it, itâ€™s the same bread as in the bakery, 
Itâ€™s main use is for small villages who donâ€™t have bakeries anymore 
As most small bakeries are dying, many small villages are left alone

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]Ususal_User 1314 points1315 points1316 points 14 days ago (225 children)That sounds pretty sad

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]Quick-Rub3665 858 points859 points860 points 14 days ago (176 children)Well itâ€™s just the way the business is evolving, but it is indeed very unfortunate, a lot of hardworking people lose their businesses, and the growing of bakery chains is one of the causes, almost a 1000 bakeries from chains have now opened

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]Omnitographer 533 points534 points535 points 14 days ago (138 children)Given how aggressively protective of their culture the French are I'm surprised there isn't a law against bakery franchises.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]MrKonny 516 points517 points518 points 14 days ago (101 children)That's the net part ! There is a law for it, you can't name you bakery a "Bakery" if the bread aren't made in place. All the process step to made the bread need to be done in selling place.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]tokyotochicago 289 points290 points291 points 14 days ago (73 children)And it allowed a lot of us to discover just how far you can stretch the meaning of "made here" lmao

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]MrKonny 89 points90 points91 points 14 days ago (7 children)Made here is also a protected label, but i don't remember the requirement to get this label..
But most of tourist restaurent used the label without having it, they use a slightly modified label to play with law.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]AtlasZX 27 points28 points29 points 14 days ago (3 children)The label "made here" was made here... not the product.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]Ty-Fighter501 48 points49 points50 points 14 days ago (29 children)Does that make a difference?  I donâ€™t know shit about bread, but wouldâ€™ve assumed thatâ€™s just as good until reading this. lol

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]Jackski 97 points98 points99 points 14 days ago (11 children)Frozen dough isn't as good as freshly made. It won't make too much of a difference after filling it up with meat, cheese, vegetables and sauces like subway do though.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreplycontinue this thread[â€“]boldjoy0050 34 points35 points36 points 14 days ago (5 children)You know how a frozen pizza and a freshly made one taste totally different? It's the same with bread.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreplycontinue this thread[â€“]beeeel 34 points35 points36 points 14 days ago (4 children)No, it's definitely not the same. If you just want soft bread with no texture or flavour, it's fine, but if you compare to fresh bread from a good bakery it's apples and oranges.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreplycontinue this thread[â€“]towelrod 14 points15 points16 points 14 days ago (1 child)Judging by the quality of the bread at Subway, yeah. It makes a difference

Or maybe Ireland?? Idk, but someone said "absolutely not" to subway & I love that.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]Mammoth-Mud-9609 11 points12 points13 points 14 days ago (3 children)France has very strict laws on what is allowed to go into making bread in general not just specific to subway.
The law states that traditional baguettes have to be made on the premises they're sold and can only be made with four ingredients: wheat flour, water, salt and yeast. They can't be frozen at any stage or contain additives or preservatives, which also means they go stale within 24 hours.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]Merbleuxx 29 points30 points31 points 14 days ago (9 children)Thereâ€™s also a law protecting a type of bread. Thatâ€™s why when you ask for a baguette in France you ask for a Â« tradition Â».

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]sybrwookie 35 points36 points37 points 14 days ago (1 child)Right, because if the bread wasn't made there, it's legally just a sparkling bread.

Just have your big bucks infrastructure buy and ship everything to shop, assemble (bake) with your big machines, bam, youâ€™re a bakery. 
Costs would be much easier to cover for those big companies than small bussinesses

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]SpaceJackRabbit 7 points8 points9 points 14 days ago (2 children)Not exactly. You can't call it a bakery in France if the bread is just baked there â€“ those are called "point chaud". To be able to call it a bakery, the bread needs to be made and baked on site.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]os_2342 2 points3 points4 points 14 days ago (0 children)You can only call it a "sparkling bread".

So the bread must be made in it by real bakers (with a baker degree).

Caus if you arrived at even 9 or 10am all the fresh, good stuff was long gone. That and half the point wasnt actually to buy bread but chat to everyone in the queue. You couldnt just get your baguette and leave, that would be rude. You have to check in with the store owner, hows the wife and kids etc, etc.
And while there is definitely something idyllic about that sort of life, I can for sure see the point of conveniance here.

What's happening in the region where I'm from is that bunches of nearby villages try to collectivise all their services. So let's say there's one remaining baker out of five villages, they will go do a round and drop a bunch of baguettes and other basic breads every morning at whatever places still exist there in the other villages (small convenience store, post office, tabac shop, even the school or city hall sometimes) so that the locals can get their fresh bread daily without having to drive.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]Algent 19 points20 points21 points 14 days ago (7 children)Yeah but due to being on EU electric market and it's price being indexed on gas this have been a massive mess to stay polite.
Also due to being gov owned Engie is forced to sell at heavy loss to third parties reseller and to rebuy it from them at the price they want (market+ their cut). Which put them in crazy debt because they basically can't even cover their own cost.

And most machines are connected, so you can follow the stock via an app on your phone, 
Just fyi a good machine costs between 10 to 15kâ‚¬

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]bsnimunf 30 points31 points32 points 14 days ago (14 children)50 a day doesn't sound that great. What's the profit on a baguette after variable cost are deducted?

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]timothina 48 points49 points50 points 14 days ago (13 children)Suppose you make 50 cents a baguette, so 25 â‚¬ a day.  The machine would pay for itself in 400 days, or a little over a year.  If the machine lasts ten years, that is pretty good.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]ldkv 45 points46 points47 points 14 days ago (1 child)You forgot the daily delivery and maintenance cost for each machine.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]sb452[] 2 points3 points4 points 13 days ago (0 children)
Suppose you make 50 cents a baguette, 

50 cents is the profit per baguette, not the sale price. Profit = sale price minus expenses, which includes delivery cost.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]davesy69 28 points29 points30 points 14 days ago (0 children)You also have to pay for a driver and a van out of that.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]FrenchFryCattaneo 7 points8 points9 points 14 days ago (2 children)That does not sound good. Most of the profit would need to cover the overhead in the bakery itself, and you didn't include the overhead of stocking and operating the machine.

When we go there for the weekend, we pass one of these. It's a normal baguette, nothing special but still has the typical high quality you see in French bakeries in general. They are â‚¬1 each and they come out of the machine hot.
Usually pick a few up on the way home because they're better than the white bread we get in Germany. Eat one in the car and the rest with dinner.
Oh, and the machines are available on Sunday when the bakeries are closed, which is really nice.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]sadicologue 5 points6 points7 points 14 days ago (0 children)It's usualy a local bakerie who makes the bread every day and sell it trough those machine. Often in small city where the Boulanger can't afford someone to work 7am to 7pm to sell directly in the bakerie so they'll have those kind of vending machine to make Ã  few more sales

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]TheOtherAshaller 4 points5 points6 points 14 days ago (0 children)Decent, stocked up fresh in the morning, if you buy it at the end of the day may be less quality but exact same issue if you buy it in boulangerie

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]SkepticalJohn 2 points3 points4 points 14 days ago (0 children)I used to go up to Albuquerque (100miles) with a neighbor (4 miles) every couple of weeks for groceries and sashimi (he needed sashimi). One time we went to a new artisanal bakery. It advertised baguettes and I got one to see his reaction. He gave it a squeeze and with a slight sneer and a raised eyebrow he said, "It is a batard." Then he told me about his job as a five-year-old just after WW2 in Normandy. He was to go to the boulangerie before breakfast and bring back a baguette. Then, in late morning he would go back again and get another. "Why not get two the first time?", I asked. "Who would eat a morning baguette at lunch?", he replied.

I know it's for comedic effect but to give an overview on french stereotypes: in reality you no longer see a mime on the streets. Like never.
Except a handful of old guys in the basque area and busloads of UK or US female tourists no one wears a beret.
Also the "mariniÃ¨re" strippes is rather limited to female summerwear, like sundresses, tshirts, wool pullovers for chilly Brittany nights. Won't see it that often in Paris or on men IMO.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreplyload more comments (8 replies)load more comments (3 replies)[â€“]kerflair 29 points30 points31 points 14 days ago (0 children)the classic baguette is a bread with a very white and very airy crumb, the tradition has a more generous crust and a slightly yellow crumb that is more elastic and dense.  Tradition baguette is much better but contain often more gluten.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]Poglosaurus 18 points19 points20 points 14 days ago* (3 children)Classic is basically anything the baker wants it to be. It's the recipe he has developed that use what is locally available cheaply. As another user said it will usually be very white and fluffy, made with yeast and enriched flour. 
A tradition is more expensive and is made with a recipe that is regulated. Pure flour, water and salt. No additive. It's much more labour intensive and also needs a full day to proof.

You find them for eggs, meat, pastries etc. all the products are fresh. 
We donâ€™t have 24/7 shops on every corner so itâ€™s sometimes the only way of buying things. These baguettes where certainly baked that morning and this machine is likely just outside the bakery they were baked at or in a smaller village close by without its own bakery.
It saves on expensive labour and does exactly the same job.

Edit: wow, this blew up! Just for the record, I am German and I love genuine French bread, so I was curious about the quality.

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]Quick-Rub3665 3116 points3117 points3118 points 14 days ago (298 children)It is actually quite good, several times a day ( depending on the baker ) come to reload it, itâ€™s the same bread as in the bakery, 
Itâ€™s main use is for small villages who donâ€™t have bakeries anymore 
As most small bakeries are dying, many small villages are left alone

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]Omnitographer 533 points534 points535 points 14 days ago (138 children)Given how aggressively protective of their culture the French are I'm surprised there isn't a law against bakery franchises.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]MrKonny 516 points517 points518 points 14 days ago (101 children)That's the net part ! There is a law for it, you can't name you bakery a "Bakery" if the bread aren't made in place. All the process step to made the bread need to be done in selling place.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]tokyotochicago 289 points290 points291 points 14 days ago (73 children)And it allowed a lot of us to discover just how far you can stretch the meaning of "made here" lmao

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]MrKonny 89 points90 points91 points 14 days ago (7 children)Made here is also a protected label, but i don't remember the requirement to get this label..
But most of tourist restaurent used the label without having it, they use a slightly modified label to play with law.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]Ty-Fighter501 48 points49 points50 points 14 days ago (29 children)Does that make a difference?  I donâ€™t know shit about bread, but wouldâ€™ve assumed thatâ€™s just as good until reading this. lol

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]Jackski 97 points98 points99 points 14 days ago (11 children)Frozen dough isn't as good as freshly made. It won't make too much of a difference after filling it up with meat, cheese, vegetables and sauces like subway do though.

If you just want soft bread with no texture or flavour, it's fine, but if you compare to fresh bread from a good bakery it's apples and oranges.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreplycontinue this thread[â€“]towelrod 14 points15 points16 points 14 days ago (1 child)Judging by the quality of the bread at Subway, yeah. It makes a difference

Or maybe Ireland?? Idk, but someone said "absolutely not" to subway & I love that.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]Mammoth-Mud-9609 11 points12 points13 points 14 days ago (3 children)France has very strict laws on what is allowed to go into making bread in general not just specific to subway.
The law states that traditional baguettes have to be made on the premises they're sold and can only be made with four ingredients: wheat flour, water, salt and yeast. They can't be frozen at any stage or contain additives or preservatives, which also means they go stale within 24 hours.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]Merbleuxx 29 points30 points31 points 14 days ago (9 children)Thereâ€™s also a law protecting a type of bread. Thatâ€™s why when you ask for a baguette in France you ask for a Â« tradition Â».

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]sybrwookie 35 points36 points37 points 14 days ago (1 child)Right, because if the bread wasn't made there, it's legally just a sparkling bread.

Just have your big bucks infrastructure buy and ship everything to shop, assemble (bake) with your big machines, bam, youâ€™re a bakery. 
Costs would be much easier to cover for those big companies than small bussinesses

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]SpaceJackRabbit 7 points8 points9 points 14 days ago (2 children)Not exactly. You can't call it a bakery in France if the bread is just baked there â€“ those are called "point chaud". To be able to call it a bakery, the bread needs to be made and baked on site.

So the bread must be made in it by real bakers (with a baker degree).

Caus if you arrived at even 9 or 10am all the fresh, good stuff was long gone. That and half the point wasnt actually to buy bread but chat to everyone in the queue. You couldnt just get your baguette and leave, that would be rude. You have to check in with the store owner, hows the wife and kids etc, etc.
And while there is definitely something idyllic about that sort of life, I can for sure see the point of conveniance here.

What's happening in the region where I'm from is that bunches of nearby villages try to collectivise all their services. So let's say there's one remaining baker out of five villages, they will go do a round and drop a bunch of baguettes and other basic breads every morning at whatever places still exist there in the other villages (small convenience store, post office, tabac shop, even the school or city hall sometimes) so that the locals can get their fresh bread daily without having to drive.

Also due to being gov owned Engie is forced to sell at heavy loss to third parties reseller and to rebuy it from them at the price they want (market+ their cut). Which put them in crazy debt because they basically can't even cover their own cost.

And most machines are connected, so you can follow the stock via an app on your phone,

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]bsnimunf 30 points31 points32 points 14 days ago (14 children)50 a day doesn't sound that great. What's the profit on a baguette after variable cost are deducted?

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]timothina 48 points49 points50 points 14 days ago (13 children)Suppose you make 50 cents a baguette, so 25 â‚¬ a day.  The machine would pay for itself in 400 days, or a little over a year.  If the machine lasts ten years, that is pretty good.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]ldkv 45 points46 points47 points 14 days ago (1 child)You forgot the daily delivery and maintenance cost for each machine.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]sb452[] 2 points3 points4 points 13 days ago (0 children)
Suppose you make 50 cents a baguette, 

50 cents is the profit per baguette, not the sale price. Profit = sale price minus expenses, which includes delivery cost.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]davesy69 28 points29 points30 points 14 days ago (0 children)You also have to pay for a driver and a van out of that.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]FrenchFryCattaneo 7 points8 points9 points 14 days ago (2 children)That does not sound good. Most of the profit would need to cover the overhead in the bakery itself, and you didn't include the overhead of stocking and operating the machine.

When we go there for the weekend, we pass one of these. It's a normal baguette, nothing special but still has the typical high quality you see in French bakeries in general. They are â‚¬1 each and they come out of the machine hot.
Usually pick a few up on the way home because they're better than the white bread we get in Germany. Eat one in the car and the rest with dinner.
Oh, and the machines are available on Sunday when the bakeries are closed, which is really nice.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]Touniouk 8 points9 points10 points 14 days ago (1 child)Depends on the baker, but for my money it averages between ok and really good. The machine is an oven so it keeps the bread hot, comes out of here just right

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]sadicologue 5 points6 points7 points 14 days ago (0 children)It's usualy a local bakerie who makes the bread every day and sell it trough those machine. Often in small city where the Boulanger can't afford someone to work 7am to 7pm to sell directly in the bakerie so they'll have those kind of vending machine to make Ã  few more sales

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]SkepticalJohn 2 points3 points4 points 14 days ago (0 children)I used to go up to Albuquerque (100miles) with a neighbor (4 miles) every couple of weeks for groceries and sashimi (he needed sashimi). One time we went to a new artisanal bakery. It advertised baguettes and I got one to see his reaction. He gave it a squeeze and with a slight sneer and a raised eyebrow he said, "It is a batard." Then he told me about his job as a five-year-old just after WW2 in Normandy. He was to go to the boulangerie before breakfast and bring back a baguette. Then, in late morning he would go back again and get another. "Why not get two the first time?", I asked. "Who would eat a morning baguette at lunch?", he replied.

I know it's for comedic effect but to give an overview on french stereotypes: in reality you no longer see a mime on the streets. Like never.
Except a handful of old guys in the basque area and busloads of UK or US female tourists no one wears a beret.
Also the "mariniÃ¨re" strippes is rather limited to female summerwear, like sundresses, tshirts, wool pullovers for chilly Brittany nights. Won't see it that often in Paris or on men IMO.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreplyload more comments (8 replies)load more comments (3 replies)[â€“]kerflair 29 points30 points31 points 14 days ago (0 children)the classic baguette is a bread with a very white and very airy crumb, the tradition has a more generous crust and a slightly yellow crumb that is more elastic and dense.  Tradition baguette is much better but contain often more gluten.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]Poglosaurus 18 points19 points20 points 14 days ago* (3 children)Classic is basically anything the baker wants it to be. It's the recipe he has developed that use what is locally available cheaply. As another user said it will usually be very white and fluffy, made with yeast and enriched flour. 
A tradition is more expensive and is made with a recipe that is regulated. Pure flour, water and salt. No additive. It's much more labour intensive and also needs a full day to proof.

You find them for eggs, meat, pastries etc. all the products are fresh. 
We donâ€™t have 24/7 shops on every corner so itâ€™s sometimes the only way of buying things. These baguettes where certainly baked that morning and this machine is likely just outside the bakery they were baked at or in a smaller village close by without its own bakery.
It saves on expensive labour and does exactly the same job.
