
permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]XDrake67[S] 53 points54 points55 points 5 hours ago (13 children)Been a 160-180h playthrough (not counting savescum :D) threw 3 month and an half, where i tried every possible quest i could,Its hard to start again so fast, need to chill a bit haha

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]SupremeLobster 33 points34 points35 points 3 hours ago (1 child)But you've only done all those quests one way. 
There are many ways they can play out and you can be various amount of good or shitty. 
The possibilities are ALL CONSUMING. 
Be one with baldurs gate.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]XDrake67[S] 8 points9 points10 points 2 hours ago (0 children)So far im keeping those reaction for my multiplayer run, is so damn good to see new way of ending quests with friends, despite checking every fucking rock on the map in your own playthrough

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]IMissTescoValuePizza 6 points7 points8 points 2 hours ago (2 children)When i tried to play again i remembered all the container i must open everywhere i just nop.nope.nup.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]XDrake67[S] 3 points4 points5 points 2 hours ago (0 children)Exactly! Guess I'll do like i do with Mass effect, a run every few year where i forgot most of it! (tho i might try dark urge sooner)

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]TarusR 2 points3 points4 points 1 hour ago (0 children)And all those skellies that have to be spotted by my own eyes

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]average_red 1 point2 points3 points 2 hours ago (4 children)I did exactly the same, a near 200 hour tiefling warlock first run where I explored everything and did everything.  I took a few days off and played through Spiderman 2, then I was able to jump right back into a new drow paladin run.  I'm about 10-20 hours in and while it's wildly different in many respects, it's just as fun.  You might just need a palate cleanser because BG3 is a very rich bold taste.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]pahamack 2 points3 points4 points 1 hour ago (2 children)If thereâ€™s anything I dislike about this game, and games like it, itâ€™s looting and inventory management.
Likeâ€¦ Iâ€™ll do it, but it takes so much time and itâ€™s not the fun part.
Thereâ€™s no reason to make every body and so many boxes lootable. Thereâ€™s no reason to be able to loot 5 billion goblin bows. 
Itâ€™s not like we canâ€™t just make them unlootable for realism: all these enemies have unlootable things on their bodies. Itâ€™s not like we can take their underwear.
In tabletop dnd itâ€™s not like your dm is just gonna allow you to dump 30 daggers on some merchant.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]XDrake67[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)Thanks god there was some Mod for this, at least so we can sort each type of equipment (head / gloves , etc...)

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]Puzzleheaded-Ad-6612 0 points1 point2 points 6 minutes ago (0 children)What! ðŸ˜± looting and inventory management is the best aspect! I save inventory management for Saturday when I have time to really appreciate it. Oh the sweet dopamine! Stuff and more stuff, organize it, fitting and trying, selling and buying ðŸ˜

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]Tucker_Bio 0 points1 point2 points 59 minutes ago (0 children)I just finished a run as a Drow paladin, did you go Lolthsworn or Seldarine?

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]Avilola 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour ago (0 children)I thought I did every possible quest on my first playthrough. Spoiler alert, I did not.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]StateSenClaytonDavis[] 0 points1 point2 points 2 hours ago (0 children)I thought that. Then I started a Durge playthrough the next day...

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]Odd_Contact_2175 1 point2 points3 points 2 hours ago (0 children)I didn't think I would after putting 100 hours in my first playthrough...then I started with my Monk and am cruising through Act 1 lol

The game is consuming me.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]Okryhru 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)This is for tv shows, with bg3 you can just start over and do everything different ðŸ˜†

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]ZarosianSpear 20 points21 points22 points 5 hours ago (3 children)OP needs some time to accept that there won't be another Larian game for at least 3 years. And a DLC for 1 year, if any.

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]Andysaurus-rex1 5 points6 points7 points 3 hours ago (1 child)BG3 is my first experience with Larian games. Shortly in to playing it I bought Divinity 2 on sale. 
I like playing co-op story games with my friend and thereâ€™s surprisingly few that are good. Baldurâ€™s Gate 3 has kept us occupied for a while but weâ€™re in act 3 and itâ€™s only a matter of time now.

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]Elllieah 12 points13 points14 points 5 hours ago (2 children)Let's go for the second play through! Another person to romance (or more?), another race, another class and a diff team comp? ;D

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]Machuseth 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour ago (0 children)Did exactly this! 1st one was a good guy playthrough, now its time for the evil one >:)

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]XDrake67[S] 0 points1 point2 points 2 hours ago (0 children)Well... thats the issue, i swapped every character when i could, so i saw a LOT of companion stories, Also, if i romance another, will probably be Karlach and ... im not ready to force her again for this ending :(

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]miss_vakarian 5 points6 points7 points 5 hours ago (0 children)I feel this. I started my second playthrough an hour after i finished my first, and many other runs followed that. I am on my sixth playthrough and the good news is that it does not get boring. Just try another class and a slightly or complete different playstyle and you will have a lot of fun! I still discover new things and i love it.

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]Pig_Becker 4 points5 points6 points 4 hours ago (2 children)Same here, I just started Starfield and thought 'well. . . this is shit'

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]girlminuslife 1 point2 points3 points 3 hours ago (0 children)Omg yes. Three hours in I knew I was never gonna love it - it was cold, empty, shallow. Gave it up.

Yes I know how you feel.
I actually need to sever. In the middle of another playthrough but a new bug has stopped me from being able to go any further (yes there are awkward, glitchy workarounds, but I can't be bothered).
Might be the best thing that's ever happened to me. I've been THAT mopey guy for about a month now. An opportunity to be free (at least until Larian fixes all the Act 3 bugs that weren't there before).

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]squirrelmangler69 2 points3 points4 points 5 hours ago (0 children)Completely normal. I miss a few of my DND characters and in this game I really liked my first Durge run and kinda miss the first guy I've made.

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]wrongweektoquitglue 2 points3 points4 points 4 hours ago (0 children)I kinda want to be done with BG 3 for a while because I want to get back into Cyberpunk 2077 now that CDPR finally fleshed out the combat mechanics and released the DLC, but I can't because I also just want to play BG 3.

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]martanimate 2 points3 points4 points 4 hours ago (0 children)....I started a new game within moments of the ending

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]pale_vulture 2 points3 points4 points 3 hours ago (5 children)Time to pick up Divinity Original Sin 2

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]XDrake67[S] 2 points3 points4 points 3 hours ago (4 children)Fun fact, i've tried it since 2017 once, twice , three time, i felt it was too boring
I tried again in 2020 with friends (then solo), loved it  
And thats the main reason i tried BG3 here :)

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]pale_vulture 0 points1 point2 points 2 hours ago (3 children)Same, haha, it's quite hard to get into but once you are there it just clicks. 
Maybe Disco Elysium then?

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]XDrake67[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (2 children)Its on my wish list for a while, but the art direction is blocking me so far (so was FF7 OG, needed time to get into it)

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]pale_vulture 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (1 child)Aye, absolutely take your time. Imo the gane us beautiful and one of a kind, but don't rush yourself! Maybe something light after such a heavy game like bg3 is the better choice haha

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]XDrake67[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)Yeah, my thought exactly! Probably gonna do some LOL game to lose some mental, then i'll come back to this peaceful games

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]ATX_Gentleman 2 points3 points4 points 2 hours ago (0 children)Now the fun begins in finding all the new dialogue and scenarios from different playthroughs.

Drow Female
Low Charisma (or high charisma)
Dark Urge
Shadowheart
Evil
Paladin (Oathbreaker or Oathkeeper)

...

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]preemcuz 1 point2 points3 points 4 hours ago (0 children)Rerolled a new character right away, upon beating the game for the first time

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]Aimero 1 point2 points3 points 4 hours ago (0 children)The best ending imho is Durge siding with Orpheus, get Minthara, let Astarion ascend and Shadowheart is a Dark Justiziar.

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]TTV-BattyPrincess 1 point2 points3 points 3 hours ago (0 children)And you didn't immediately start a new playthrough? uwÃº

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]Unrealist99 0 points1 point2 points 4 hours ago (0 children)I know. Or thought i did. It was over 170 hours for me too. 
Until i realized how much i missed. So i jumped in again.  
Somehow i find myself in the middle of a fourth playthrough

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]Lazypidgey 0 points1 point2 points 4 hours ago (0 children)I'm the exact opposite. I haven't even finished my first playthrough and it's taking a lot of willpower for me to not start a second playthrough with my new character idea

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]afictionalaccountOathbreaker Paladin Durge 0 points1 point2 points 3 hours ago (0 children)I finished mine and the next day started a new run, this time I'm doing Dark Urge.
I might stop there, maybe...

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]Kamei86 0 points1 point2 points 3 hours ago (0 children)Now start the game again with mods!

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]ImNotASWFanboy 0 points1 point2 points 3 hours ago (0 children)The secret to avoiding this feeling is to keep doing more playthroughs until you burn out and the game is now dead to you

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]Mercerskye 0 points1 point2 points 3 hours ago (0 children)I think this is going to be me. I could swear I'm almost through act 3...and it just keeps getting bigger and bigger...
I wrap up one quest, tie up a loose end, and five more show up. I mean, I don't necessarily want the ride to end, but I've managed to stay mostly spoiler free, and I'm dying to see how things wrap up.
When I get there, I'm pretty sure I'm going to need like a day or two to decompress

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]onlinewarrior083 0 points1 point2 points 3 hours ago (0 children)It happened to me too

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]CaptainHateful 0 points1 point2 points 3 hours ago (0 children)I started a new run immediately after beating the game. Honestly I was tempted to start another parallel run while I was still working on my first one just to see the differences.

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]PsyHorse 0 points1 point2 points 3 hours ago (0 children)This is for tv shows, with bg3 you can just start over and do everything different ðŸ˜†

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]TheRainbowpill93Bard 0 points1 point2 points 3 hours ago (1 child)Iâ€™m 80 hours in at lvl8 and just about to get to the crÃ¨che lol. Iâ€™ve done Underdark and some of the shadow lands.  I know Iâ€™ve barely scratched the surface of Act 2. 
Granted, a good part of those 80 hours was character creation , exploration and really getting deep with my teams builds and items. 
How huge is this game ? Apparently act 3 is even longer ??

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]XDrake67[S] 0 points1 point2 points 3 hours ago (0 children)I'd say Act 3 is about 2 thirds of act 1 + 2 
You have so much things to do in here (maybe too mcuh for some people)

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]v0yev0da 0 points1 point2 points 3 hours ago (0 children)I took a week off then started a new game. Iâ€™m going through this one VERRY slowly and trying to RP as Durge would. So far so good

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]Marliesia 0 points1 point2 points 2 hours ago (1 child)See, that's why my first playthrough keeps sitting in act 3 while I keep playing a second playthrough already.

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]XDrake67[S] 0 points1 point2 points 2 hours ago (0 children)haha , i feel you, i had a break between act, and i didnt wanted to start act 3, i didnt knew why, tho i LOVED first 2 acts, but once you're in, you wont stop and enjoy every part of it :)

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]dingdong-666 0 points1 point2 points 2 hours ago (0 children)I was actually so excited to finish the game so I could start my durge playthrough

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]riqueoak 0 points1 point2 points 2 hours ago (0 children)I assure you that you missed something and will have another blast playing again with a different character and approach, just go for it.

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]Adjective-Noun12 0 points1 point2 points 2 hours ago (0 children)Start up a second playthrough as one of the story characters.  I'm doing Durge (trying to not be lol) for second and it's a different game!

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]Saaslil 0 points1 point2 points 2 hours ago (0 children)I'm about to finish it, doing the final events this evening. And to avoid feeling that kind of void in me, I already have a Durge save ready to play.

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]AlchemyWizard 0 points1 point2 points 2 hours ago (1 child)Just the difference between playing a ranged class vs melee class is a huge difference.  Then you can do good vs evil, a thief run, a murder hobo run, and so on.

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]XDrake67[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)About the first point , I played a college of sword bard soooo....
But it ill probably be a dark huge run !

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]Kevolved 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)I felt this way with elden ring, then BG3 came up. I'm still playing BG3 but I'm also not really mad. Video games should be fun. If there isn't a game out there that I have fun playing, I just don't play videogames.

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]Grimnir106 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)time to start a new run

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]Plinketto91 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)My first play through was 120 ish hours ....as soon as the credits finished I started a new one. Act 1 felt like a lifetime ago, so it's been refreshing to see some old and "alive again" faces.

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]Frozenbbowl 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)You finished first playthrough yes.  But what about second playthrough
And durge playthrough... And each origin playthrough for the bonus content, and honor playthrough (coming soon?) And....

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]kmdietri 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)10 hours ago here.... hopefully I can put it down for a while now...it was consuming me.

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]Tucker_Bio 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)Do a Dark urge run! You'll notice so much more this time around and you get a lot of extra story bits! I missed a lot in first playthrough, like Ethel in the grove as a shopkeeper etc., 
The fun only stops if you let it

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]Zanchbot 0 points1 point2 points 55 minutes ago (0 children)I felt this when I finished. I was planning to take some time away, play something else, then come back for a second playthrough. But the very next day I was fiending for it again and started my 2nd.

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]Misswinter69 0 points1 point2 points 33 minutes ago (0 children)I found the endings a bit crappy tbh, all the hours spend leading up and then the ending cut scenes seemed very short and lacking. Didn't stop me starting several more play throughs tho ðŸ˜†

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]TheOnlyNadCha 0 points1 point2 points 25 minutes ago (0 children)Thatâ€™s exactly why I started a second playthrough the day after, and another one after that. Now Iâ€™m forced to have a break until their next patch due to ps5 performance issues that made act 3 terribly frustrating, so Iâ€™m watching series in the meantimeâ€¦ and I feel that void.

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]Puzzleheaded-Ad-6612 0 points1 point2 points 11 minutes ago (0 children)Great meme! exactly how I feel when I am done with a great game or book. 
I have learned my lesson though, so I have never actually finished the game. 
I started a new game after act 1, to make the character just the way I wanted it. Played smarter and got more gear I missed the first time. I did this a few times before landing on a satisfied character, an evil drow which of course romanced The nightwarden. After playing evil to half way in act 3, I started up again with a good character and romanced Karlac. I am going to the end with this one. 
I wish there were more content ðŸ˜ž Itâ€™s really small. 
I played 2000 hours on Skyrim before finally beating the ebony warrior with my favorite character, cause I was so scared to end it.

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]XDrake67[S] 53 points54 points55 points 5 hours ago (13 children)Been a 160-180h playthrough (not counting savescum :D) threw 3 month and an half, where i tried every possible quest i could,Its hard to start again so fast, need to chill a bit haha

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]SupremeLobster 33 points34 points35 points 3 hours ago (1 child)But you've only done all those quests one way. 
There are many ways they can play out and you can be various amount of good or shitty. 
The possibilities are ALL CONSUMING. 
Be one with baldurs gate.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]XDrake67[S] 8 points9 points10 points 2 hours ago (0 children)So far im keeping those reaction for my multiplayer run, is so damn good to see new way of ending quests with friends, despite checking every fucking rock on the map in your own playthrough

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]IMissTescoValuePizza 6 points7 points8 points 2 hours ago (2 children)When i tried to play again i remembered all the container i must open everywhere i just nop.nope.nup.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]XDrake67[S] 3 points4 points5 points 2 hours ago (0 children)Exactly! Guess I'll do like i do with Mass effect, a run every few year where i forgot most of it! (tho i might try dark urge sooner)

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]TarusR 2 points3 points4 points 1 hour ago (0 children)And all those skellies that have to be spotted by my own eyes

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]average_red 1 point2 points3 points 2 hours ago (4 children)I did exactly the same, a near 200 hour tiefling warlock first run where I explored everything and did everything.  I took a few days off and played through Spiderman 2, then I was able to jump right back into a new drow paladin run.  I'm about 10-20 hours in and while it's wildly different in many respects, it's just as fun.  You might just need a palate cleanser because BG3 is a very rich bold taste.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]pahamack 2 points3 points4 points 1 hour ago (2 children)If thereâ€™s anything I dislike about this game, and games like it, itâ€™s looting and inventory management.
Likeâ€¦ Iâ€™ll do it, but it takes so much time and itâ€™s not the fun part.
Thereâ€™s no reason to make every body and so many boxes lootable. Thereâ€™s no reason to be able to loot 5 billion goblin bows. 
Itâ€™s not like we canâ€™t just make them unlootable for realism: all these enemies have unlootable things on their bodies. Itâ€™s not like we can take their underwear.
In tabletop dnd itâ€™s not like your dm is just gonna allow you to dump 30 daggers on some merchant.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]XDrake67[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)Thanks god there was some Mod for this, at least so we can sort each type of equipment (head / gloves , etc...)

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]Puzzleheaded-Ad-6612 0 points1 point2 points 6 minutes ago (0 children)What! ðŸ˜± looting and inventory management is the best aspect! I save inventory management for Saturday when I have time to really appreciate it. Oh the sweet dopamine! Stuff and more stuff, organize it, fitting and trying, selling and buying ðŸ˜

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]Tucker_Bio 0 points1 point2 points 59 minutes ago (0 children)I just finished a run as a Drow paladin, did you go Lolthsworn or Seldarine?

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]Avilola 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour ago (0 children)I thought I did every possible quest on my first playthrough. Spoiler alert, I did not.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]RoyTheCrow 0 points1 point2 points 5 hours ago (0 children)same

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]StateSenClaytonDavis[] 0 points1 point2 points 2 hours ago (0 children)I thought that. Then I started a Durge playthrough the next day...

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]Odd_Contact_2175 1 point2 points3 points 2 hours ago (0 children)I didn't think I would after putting 100 hours in my first playthrough...then I started with my Monk and am cruising through Act 1 lol

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]SupremeLobster 0 points1 point2 points 3 hours ago (0 children)I haven't finished a playthrough and no immediately made a new character yet lol. I'm on my 4th. 
The game is consuming me.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]Okryhru 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)This is for tv shows, with bg3 you can just start over and do everything different ðŸ˜†

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]Kujaix 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)Started a 3rd before getting far in my 2nd and never   finished my 1st.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]Moregft 0 points1 point2 points 21 minutes ago (0 children)Same here, I just started Starfield and thought 'well. . . this is shit'

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]nadiateo 40 points41 points42 points 5 hours ago (2 children)A support group should be created for this.... Hi, my name is Nadia and I am addicted to BG3.

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]onlyspacemonkey 10 points11 points12 points 2 hours ago (1 child)group in unison Hi Nadia.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]nadiateo 3 points4 points5 points 1 hour ago (0 children):D

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]ZarosianSpear 20 points21 points22 points 5 hours ago (3 children)OP needs some time to accept that there won't be another Larian game for at least 3 years. And a DLC for 1 year, if any.

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]Andysaurus-rex1 5 points6 points7 points 3 hours ago (1 child)BG3 is my first experience with Larian games. Shortly in to playing it I bought Divinity 2 on sale. 
I like playing co-op story games with my friend and thereâ€™s surprisingly few that are good. Baldurâ€™s Gate 3 has kept us occupied for a while but weâ€™re in act 3 and itâ€™s only a matter of time now.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]XDrake67[S] 2 points3 points4 points 2 hours ago (0 children)exactly :D

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]scones_coven 17 points18 points19 points 6 hours ago (0 children)I know how you feel.

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]Elllieah 12 points13 points14 points 5 hours ago (2 children)Let's go for the second play through! Another person to romance (or more?), another race, another class and a diff team comp? ;D

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]Machuseth 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour ago (0 children)Did exactly this! 1st one was a good guy playthrough, now its time for the evil one >:)

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]XDrake67[S] 0 points1 point2 points 2 hours ago (0 children)Well... thats the issue, i swapped every character when i could, so i saw a LOT of companion stories, Also, if i romance another, will probably be Karlach and ... im not ready to force her again for this ending :(

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]miss_vakarian 5 points6 points7 points 5 hours ago (0 children)I feel this. I started my second playthrough an hour after i finished my first, and many other runs followed that. I am on my sixth playthrough and the good news is that it does not get boring. Just try another class and a slightly or complete different playstyle and you will have a lot of fun! I still discover new things and i love it.

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]Pig_Becker 4 points5 points6 points 4 hours ago (2 children)Same here, I just started Starfield and thought 'well. . . this is shit'

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]girlminuslife 1 point2 points3 points 3 hours ago (0 children)Omg yes. Three hours in I knew I was never gonna love it - it was cold, empty, shallow. Gave it up.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]XDrake67[S] -1 points0 points1 point 3 hours ago (0 children)You dont love every characters looking deep in your eyes ? i dont get it... (/s)

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]InsektikorLaezel is my queen 2 points3 points4 points 5 hours ago (0 children)MY HEART
Yes I know how you feel.
I actually need to sever. In the middle of another playthrough but a new bug has stopped me from being able to go any further (yes there are awkward, glitchy workarounds, but I can't be bothered).
Might be the best thing that's ever happened to me. I've been THAT mopey guy for about a month now. An opportunity to be free (at least until Larian fixes all the Act 3 bugs that weren't there before).

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]squirrelmangler69 2 points3 points4 points 5 hours ago (0 children)Completely normal. I miss a few of my DND characters and in this game I really liked my first Durge run and kinda miss the first guy I've made.

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]wrongweektoquitglue 2 points3 points4 points 4 hours ago (0 children)I kinda want to be done with BG 3 for a while because I want to get back into Cyberpunk 2077 now that CDPR finally fleshed out the combat mechanics and released the DLC, but I can't because I also just want to play BG 3.

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]martanimate 2 points3 points4 points 4 hours ago (0 children)....I started a new game within moments of the ending

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]pale_vulture 2 points3 points4 points 3 hours ago (5 children)Time to pick up Divinity Original Sin 2

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]XDrake67[S] 2 points3 points4 points 3 hours ago (4 children)Fun fact, i've tried it since 2017 once, twice , three time, i felt it was too boring
I tried again in 2020 with friends (then solo), loved it  
And thats the main reason i tried BG3 here :)

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]pale_vulture 0 points1 point2 points 2 hours ago (3 children)Same, haha, it's quite hard to get into but once you are there it just clicks. 
Maybe Disco Elysium then?

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]XDrake67[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (2 children)Its on my wish list for a while, but the art direction is blocking me so far (so was FF7 OG, needed time to get into it)

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]pale_vulture 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (1 child)Aye, absolutely take your time. Imo the gane us beautiful and one of a kind, but don't rush yourself! Maybe something light after such a heavy game like bg3 is the better choice haha

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]XDrake67[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)Yeah, my thought exactly! Probably gonna do some LOL game to lose some mental, then i'll come back to this peaceful games

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]ATX_Gentleman 2 points3 points4 points 2 hours ago (0 children)Now the fun begins in finding all the new dialogue and scenarios from different playthroughs.

Drow Female
Low Charisma (or high charisma)
Dark Urge
Shadowheart
Evil
Paladin (Oathbreaker or Oathkeeper)

...

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]preemcuz 1 point2 points3 points 4 hours ago (0 children)Rerolled a new character right away, upon beating the game for the first time

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]Aimero 1 point2 points3 points 4 hours ago (0 children)The best ending imho is Durge siding with Orpheus, get Minthara, let Astarion ascend and Shadowheart is a Dark Justiziar.

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]TTV-BattyPrincess 1 point2 points3 points 3 hours ago (0 children)And you didn't immediately start a new playthrough? uwÃº

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]Roronoa_Zoro8615ELDRITCH BLAST 1 point2 points3 points 2 hours ago (0 children)Play it again, theres so much room for multiple playthroughs

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]Inefficacy 1 point2 points3 points 2 hours ago (0 children)Yup now I have like seven playthroughs going at once with mods lol

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]Lord_Grakas 0 points1 point2 points 4 hours ago (0 children)Dlc when?

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]Hai_Resdaynia 0 points1 point2 points 4 hours ago (0 children)Literally how I felt when I finished The Witcher 3

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]HerrRegrinBard 0 points1 point2 points 4 hours ago (0 children)Think about the good times. Take your time. Start again.

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]fiducia42 0 points1 point2 points 4 hours ago (0 children)Well it's clearly time to start another playthrough. :)

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]krismitka 0 points1 point2 points 4 hours ago (0 children)â€œFinishedâ€

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]Unrealist99 0 points1 point2 points 4 hours ago (0 children)I know. Or thought i did. It was over 170 hours for me too. 
Until i realized how much i missed. So i jumped in again.  
Somehow i find myself in the middle of a fourth playthrough

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]Lazypidgey 0 points1 point2 points 4 hours ago (0 children)I'm the exact opposite. I haven't even finished my first playthrough and it's taking a lot of willpower for me to not start a second playthrough with my new character idea

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]afictionalaccountOathbreaker Paladin Durge 0 points1 point2 points 3 hours ago (0 children)I finished mine and the next day started a new run, this time I'm doing Dark Urge.
I might stop there, maybe...

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]Kamei86 0 points1 point2 points 3 hours ago (0 children)Now start the game again with mods!

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]ImNotASWFanboy 0 points1 point2 points 3 hours ago (0 children)The secret to avoiding this feeling is to keep doing more playthroughs until you burn out and the game is now dead to you

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]Mercerskye 0 points1 point2 points 3 hours ago (0 children)I think this is going to be me. I could swear I'm almost through act 3...and it just keeps getting bigger and bigger...
I wrap up one quest, tie up a loose end, and five more show up. I mean, I don't necessarily want the ride to end, but I've managed to stay mostly spoiler free, and I'm dying to see how things wrap up.
When I get there, I'm pretty sure I'm going to need like a day or two to decompress

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]onlinewarrior083 0 points1 point2 points 3 hours ago (0 children)It happened to me too

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]CaptainHateful 0 points1 point2 points 3 hours ago (0 children)I started a new run immediately after beating the game. Honestly I was tempted to start another parallel run while I was still working on my first one just to see the differences.

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]PsyHorse 0 points1 point2 points 3 hours ago (0 children)This is for tv shows, with bg3 you can just start over and do everything different ðŸ˜†

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]TheRainbowpill93Bard 0 points1 point2 points 3 hours ago (1 child)Iâ€™m 80 hours in at lvl8 and just about to get to the crÃ¨che lol. Iâ€™ve done Underdark and some of the shadow lands.  I know Iâ€™ve barely scratched the surface of Act 2. 
Granted, a good part of those 80 hours was character creation , exploration and really getting deep with my teams builds and items. 
How huge is this game ? Apparently act 3 is even longer ??

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]XDrake67[S] 0 points1 point2 points 3 hours ago (0 children)I'd say Act 3 is about 2 thirds of act 1 + 2 
You have so much things to do in here (maybe too mcuh for some people)

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]v0yev0da 0 points1 point2 points 3 hours ago (0 children)I took a week off then started a new game. Iâ€™m going through this one VERRY slowly and trying to RP as Durge would. So far so good

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]Marliesia 0 points1 point2 points 2 hours ago (1 child)See, that's why my first playthrough keeps sitting in act 3 while I keep playing a second playthrough already.

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]XDrake67[S] 0 points1 point2 points 2 hours ago (0 children)haha , i feel you, i had a break between act, and i didnt wanted to start act 3, i didnt knew why, tho i LOVED first 2 acts, but once you're in, you wont stop and enjoy every part of it :)

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]dingdong-666 0 points1 point2 points 2 hours ago (0 children)I was actually so excited to finish the game so I could start my durge playthrough

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]Mountbatten-OttawaDurge 0 points1 point2 points 2 hours ago (0 children)Me when choosing between archfey drow warlock durge and eldritch knight human durge for my next playthrough:

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]riqueoak 0 points1 point2 points 2 hours ago (0 children)I assure you that you missed something and will have another blast playing again with a different character and approach, just go for it.

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]Adjective-Noun12 0 points1 point2 points 2 hours ago (0 children)Start up a second playthrough as one of the story characters.  I'm doing Durge (trying to not be lol) for second and it's a different game!

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]Saaslil 0 points1 point2 points 2 hours ago (0 children)I'm about to finish it, doing the final events this evening. And to avoid feeling that kind of void in me, I already have a Durge save ready to play.

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]AlchemyWizard 0 points1 point2 points 2 hours ago (1 child)Just the difference between playing a ranged class vs melee class is a huge difference.  Then you can do good vs evil, a thief run, a murder hobo run, and so on.

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]XDrake67[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)About the first point , I played a college of sword bard soooo....
But it ill probably be a dark huge run !

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]Kevolved 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)I felt this way with elden ring, then BG3 came up. I'm still playing BG3 but I'm also not really mad. Video games should be fun. If there isn't a game out there that I have fun playing, I just don't play videogames.

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]Grimnir106 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)time to start a new run

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]1347vibes 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)Every party member got a happy ending except for my OC and I'm heartbroken, especially since I avoided all spoilers so I had no clue what was going to happen. Time to start the next playthrough.

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]nr1988 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)Finished the game? What's that?

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]The_Calico_Jack 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)I immediately started another playthrough/continued one of my already started.

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]Alklazaris 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)200 hours in and I still haven't reached the gate. Close though.

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]Plinketto91 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)My first play through was 120 ish hours ....as soon as the credits finished I started a new one. Act 1 felt like a lifetime ago, so it's been refreshing to see some old and "alive again" faces.

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]Frozenbbowl 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)You finished first playthrough yes.  But what about second playthrough
And durge playthrough... And each origin playthrough for the bonus content, and honor playthrough (coming soon?) And....

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]kmdietri 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)10 hours ago here.... hopefully I can put it down for a while now...it was consuming me.

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]Tucker_Bio 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)Do a Dark urge run! You'll notice so much more this time around and you get a lot of extra story bits! I missed a lot in first playthrough, like Ethel in the grove as a shopkeeper etc., 
The fun only stops if you let it

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]Zanchbot 0 points1 point2 points 55 minutes ago (0 children)I felt this when I finished. I was planning to take some time away, play something else, then come back for a second playthrough. But the very next day I was fiending for it again and started my 2nd.

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]lovelylex3301 0 points1 point2 points 52 minutes ago (0 children)Unless you got all 17,000+ possible routes to the ending, you arenâ€™t done ðŸ˜ˆ

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]Dabrae 0 points1 point2 points 40 minutes ago (0 children)time for a  :
Durge paladin run
bard only run
barb only run
DEUS VULT paladin only run
Solo challenge

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]DefendDeathMetal 0 points1 point2 points 37 minutes ago (0 children)I have played 140 hours so far and haven't completed any of my four saves. Furthest I got was Rivington but felt the urge to start a new save with a completely different character ðŸ˜‚

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]Misswinter69 0 points1 point2 points 33 minutes ago (0 children)I found the endings a bit crappy tbh, all the hours spend leading up and then the ending cut scenes seemed very short and lacking. Didn't stop me starting several more play throughs tho ðŸ˜†

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]enchiladasundae 0 points1 point2 points 26 minutes ago (0 children)Now its time to redo it and bang a different companion

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]TheOnlyNadCha 0 points1 point2 points 25 minutes ago (0 children)Thatâ€™s exactly why I started a second playthrough the day after, and another one after that. Now Iâ€™m forced to have a break until their next patch due to ps5 performance issues that made act 3 terribly frustrating, so Iâ€™m watching series in the meantimeâ€¦ and I feel that void.

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]No-Requirement1675 0 points1 point2 points 18 minutes ago (0 children)Time to get AC Mirage. Iâ€™ve been working hard to finish BG3 so I can play it

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]jeratk 0 points1 point2 points 14 minutes ago (0 children)Brain: ....do it again...

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]Puzzleheaded-Ad-6612 0 points1 point2 points 11 minutes ago (0 children)Great meme! exactly how I feel when I am done with a great game or book. 
I have learned my lesson though, so I have never actually finished the game. 
I started a new game after act 1, to make the character just the way I wanted it. Played smarter and got more gear I missed the first time. I did this a few times before landing on a satisfied character, an evil drow which of course romanced The nightwarden. After playing evil to half way in act 3, I started up again with a good character and romanced Karlac. I am going to the end with this one. 
I wish there were more content ðŸ˜ž Itâ€™s really small. 
I played 2000 hours on Skyrim before finally beating the ebony warrior with my favorite character, cause I was so scared to end it.
