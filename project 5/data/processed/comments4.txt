His art is the most basic, uninspired, horny, average pieces of work I have ever seen. Basically a walking advertisement for an obesity fetish.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]AcherontiaPhlegethon 2 points3 points4 points 10 minutes ago (0 children)Are people literally paying millions of dollars for poor quality parodies of other art pieces? It's not like there's some stunning originality or technique on display. Everyone shits on NFTs for being obvious examples of idiocy driven displays of capital without value beyond the speculation of which it can be further scammed from another, but how is physical art any different?
Rarely are pieces priced on somewhat quantifiable criteria or even aesthetic value, rather just like NFTs the only thing that really matters is scarcity and the capacity to trick other people into thinking its also worth how much you spent. The exception to the rule is the independent small artist trade but the difference between the pay gap is insane when there's literally no difference besides arbitrary fame.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]BucBrady 49 points50 points51 points 2 hours ago (19 children)Reddit seems to believe people can't appreciate art and it's only purpose is money Laundering.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]Twombls 5 points6 points7 points 1 hour ago (0 children)It's just a thing that people said on reddit once and it gets passed around by anti intellectual chuds. Most art bought and sold at auction by collectors loses value. Of anything its reverse money laundering because you have a shitload of highly appraised stuff on display that will never sell for anywhere close to its value.
Also most art is nowhere near this amount of money.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]elcuervo2666 -2 points-1 points0 points 1 hour ago (2 children)It can be both. Art is awesome and Botero is amazing. I went to his museum in BogotÃ¡ a few years ago and was blown away. However, none of this stops people from using art to launder money and avoid taxes; it isnâ€™t one of the other.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]BucBrady 7 points8 points9 points 1 hour ago (1 child)Absolutely. It just isn't nearly as prevalent as Reddit users make it out to be.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreplyload more comments (1 reply)[â€“]BucBrady 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour ago (0 children)Whose to say this wont end up in a museum eventually?
Many museum's collections have been donated by people who had a passion for art and donated their collection after they passed.
The Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum is a great example of this and wouldn't have been possible if private collectors didn't exist.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]Twombls 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)There is not enough room in museums for every single piece of art in existence. Also creating art for private buyers is kinda how art gets valuable and famous too lol. 
Personally I own a bunch of art from local artists around me. Mostly paintings. It's not valuable at all. And it was not expensive. Should all of that be in museums?

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[+]k20350 comment score below threshold-16 points-15 points-14 points 1 hour ago* (7 children)No sane person pays $100,000,000 for a painting. It's a fucking painting. Canvas with some colored chemicals on it. Same as this ridiculous statue in OP. Or paying millions for paintings identical to what the average kindergartner makes every day during finger painting. Art is the same as horses. The cartels have long used horses as a way to move money around. It's a way to park and transfer money in a non obvious way

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]BucBrady 2 points3 points4 points 1 hour ago (0 children)Paintings that go for $100,000,000 typically are very famous and have historical value. It would be a terrible way to launder money since sales of paintings that expensive develop a lot of attention which is the opposite of what you'd want to do if you were money laundering.

In QC they are paying 53% income tax already.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]ghostfaceschiller 2 points3 points4 points 1 hour ago (13 children)For almost 50 years, the top marginal tax bracket in the US was above 70%.
For almost 20 of those years (1944-1963), it was above 90%

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]Antisocialite99 10 points11 points12 points 1 hour ago (3 children)With plenty of loopholes. Increasingly so the wealthier you get.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]ghostfaceschiller 4 points5 points6 points 1 hour ago* (2 children)Which you think means we should just give them a lower tax rate?
First of all, loopholes were not nearly as much of a thing in those decades. Most wealthy people legitimately paid close to those rates.
The expansion of what you might call the tax loophole â€œindustryâ€ basically happened from the 80â€™s forward.
Weâ€™ve been doing a great job at closing loopholes in the last two years. Increased funding to the section of the IRS that audits wealthy people. Shutting down the possibility of tax havens by getting them to agree to a global minimum tax. Instituting a domestic minimum corporate tax here which is based on the profits reported to shareholders, essentially closing wide swaths of loopholes all at once.
The solution is to find and close loopholes. Not to just give up and say â€œfine weâ€™ll just lower your tax rateâ€ as if wealthy people wouldnâ€™t just still try to find loopholes to pay even less.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]Antisocialite99 1 point2 points3 points 32 minutes ago (1 child)What? Where'd you get that I think that? Just pulling stuff from thin air. 
My point was the really rich don't actually pay those tax rates.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreplyload more comments (1 reply)[+]Flucky_ comment score below threshold-14 points-13 points-12 points 1 hour ago (8 children)yes... and there is a reason it changed. The majority of Taxes are already paid buy the top 10% of the US with Tax in the 40% range...

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]ghostfaceschiller 10 points11 points12 points 1 hour ago* (5 children)Right bc they make a majority of the money, and the more money you have, the easier it is to make even more money. Hence marginal tax rates.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[+]Flucky_ comment score below threshold-7 points-6 points-5 points 1 hour ago (4 children)Exactlyâ€¦. But there is not reason to tax them even more than what theyâ€™re being taxed atâ€¦. The government has a spending problem not an income problem

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]Carbonfibreclueâ€‹ -1 points0 points1 point 32 minutes ago (3 children)Ahh, I see you've received your education at the School of Breitbart and Fox (I mean, it's a hella coincidence that you happen to use their exact talking points).   
Such a shame they constantly misreport reality to push an agenda.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreplyload more comments (3 replies)[â€“]Carbonfibreclueâ€‹ -1 points0 points1 point 33 minutes ago (1 child)I think that you'll find that in theory, the majority of taxes should be paid the top 10% wealthiest; but in actuality they exploit numerous loopholes (as covered by another user) to pay vastly less than they should.   
But keep defending people whose concern for you extends as far as they can make money from your existence.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]Flucky_ -1 points0 points1 point 30 minutes ago (0 children)Seeing how Iâ€™m in that income bracket

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]SophiaofPrussiaâ€‹ 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (3 children)But this isnâ€™t income. Itâ€™s wealth.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]Flucky_ -3 points-2 points-1 points 49 minutes ago (2 children)Okayâ€¦. You also realize they pay the highest capital gains, etc

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]SophiaofPrussiaâ€‹ -1 points0 points1 point 26 minutes ago (1 child)No. They havenâ€™t paid a cent in capital gains. They spent $1 million on this art and itâ€™s now worth ~$4 million. That means they have accumulated ~$3 million of as-yet-untaxed wealth that they can now use to access cash via low-interest rate loans with their $4 million art as collateral. Which means they have used their tax-free wealth in order to tap tax-free income. And unless and until they sell the piece theyâ€™ll pay $0 in capital gains despite reaping quite a lot of gain in the form of liquidity & capital.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]Harinezumisan 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour ago (3 children)Not tax the rich but protect the artist by ensuring their work is not a vehicle of capital as so often with high rank artists.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]notquiteworking 4 points5 points6 points 1 hour ago (1 child)Very expensive art is often stored in free ports which are untaxed as theyâ€™re technically not inside of a country.  The art is stored in dark warehouses - tax free - where even the owner doesnâ€™t enjoy owning it.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]AcherontiaPhlegethon 2 points3 points4 points 10 minutes ago (0 children)Are people literally paying millions of dollars for poor quality parodies of other art pieces? It's not like there's some stunning originality or technique on display. Everyone shits on NFTs for being obvious examples of idiocy driven displays of capital without value beyond the speculation of which it can be further scammed from another, but how is physical art any different?
Rarely are pieces priced on somewhat quantifiable criteria or even aesthetic value, rather just like NFTs the only thing that really matters is scarcity and the capacity to trick other people into thinking its also worth how much you spent. The exception to the rule is the independent small artist trade but the difference between the pay gap is insane when there's literally no difference besides arbitrary fame.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]BucBrady 49 points50 points51 points 2 hours ago (19 children)Reddit seems to believe people can't appreciate art and it's only purpose is money Laundering.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]Twombls 5 points6 points7 points 1 hour ago (0 children)It's just a thing that people said on reddit once and it gets passed around by anti intellectual chuds. Most art bought and sold at auction by collectors loses value. Of anything its reverse money laundering because you have a shitload of highly appraised stuff on display that will never sell for anywhere close to its value.
Also most art is nowhere near this amount of money.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]elcuervo2666 -2 points-1 points0 points 1 hour ago (2 children)It can be both. Art is awesome and Botero is amazing. I went to his museum in BogotÃ¡ a few years ago and was blown away. However, none of this stops people from using art to launder money and avoid taxes; it isnâ€™t one of the other.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreplyload more comments (1 reply)[â€“]BucBrady 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour ago (0 children)Whose to say this wont end up in a museum eventually?
Many museum's collections have been donated by people who had a passion for art and donated their collection after they passed.
The Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum is a great example of this and wouldn't have been possible if private collectors didn't exist.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]Twombls 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)There is not enough room in museums for every single piece of art in existence. Also creating art for private buyers is kinda how art gets valuable and famous too lol. 
Personally I own a bunch of art from local artists around me. Mostly paintings. It's not valuable at all. And it was not expensive. Should all of that be in museums?

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[+]k20350 comment score below threshold-16 points-15 points-14 points 1 hour ago* (7 children)No sane person pays $100,000,000 for a painting. It's a fucking painting. Canvas with some colored chemicals on it. Same as this ridiculous statue in OP. Or paying millions for paintings identical to what the average kindergartner makes every day during finger painting. Art is the same as horses. The cartels have long used horses as a way to move money around. It's a way to park and transfer money in a non obvious way

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]BucBrady 2 points3 points4 points 1 hour ago (0 children)Paintings that go for $100,000,000 typically are very famous and have historical value. It would be a terrible way to launder money since sales of paintings that expensive develop a lot of attention which is the opposite of what you'd want to do if you were money laundering.

Other modern art that comes out of nowhere and itâ€™s a blank canvas that sells for 1M, Iâ€™ll agree with you there.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]ghostfaceschiller 2 points3 points4 points 1 hour ago (13 children)For almost 50 years, the top marginal tax bracket in the US was above 70%.
For almost 20 of those years (1944-1963), it was above 90%

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]Antisocialite99 10 points11 points12 points 1 hour ago (3 children)With plenty of loopholes. Increasingly so the wealthier you get.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]ghostfaceschiller 4 points5 points6 points 1 hour ago* (2 children)Which you think means we should just give them a lower tax rate?
First of all, loopholes were not nearly as much of a thing in those decades. Most wealthy people legitimately paid close to those rates.
The expansion of what you might call the tax loophole â€œindustryâ€ basically happened from the 80â€™s forward.
Weâ€™ve been doing a great job at closing loopholes in the last two years. Increased funding to the section of the IRS that audits wealthy people. Shutting down the possibility of tax havens by getting them to agree to a global minimum tax. Instituting a domestic minimum corporate tax here which is based on the profits reported to shareholders, essentially closing wide swaths of loopholes all at once.
The solution is to find and close loopholes. Not to just give up and say â€œfine weâ€™ll just lower your tax rateâ€ as if wealthy people wouldnâ€™t just still try to find loopholes to pay even less.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]Antisocialite99 1 point2 points3 points 32 minutes ago (1 child)What? Where'd you get that I think that? Just pulling stuff from thin air.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]ghostfaceschiller 10 points11 points12 points 1 hour ago* (5 children)Right bc they make a majority of the money, and the more money you have, the easier it is to make even more money. Hence marginal tax rates.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[+]Flucky_ comment score below threshold-7 points-6 points-5 points 1 hour ago (4 children)Exactlyâ€¦. But there is not reason to tax them even more than what theyâ€™re being taxed atâ€¦. The government has a spending problem not an income problem

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]SophiaofPrussiaâ€‹ -1 points0 points1 point 26 minutes ago (1 child)No. They havenâ€™t paid a cent in capital gains. They spent $1 million on this art and itâ€™s now worth ~$4 million. That means they have accumulated ~$3 million of as-yet-untaxed wealth that they can now use to access cash via low-interest rate loans with their $4 million art as collateral. Which means they have used their tax-free wealth in order to tap tax-free income. And unless and until they sell the piece theyâ€™ll pay $0 in capital gains despite reaping quite a lot of gain in the form of liquidity & capital.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]Harinezumisan 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour ago (3 children)Not tax the rich but protect the artist by ensuring their work is not a vehicle of capital as so often with high rank artists.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]notquiteworking 4 points5 points6 points 1 hour ago (1 child)Very expensive art is often stored in free ports which are untaxed as theyâ€™re technically not inside of a country.  The art is stored in dark warehouses - tax free - where even the owner doesnâ€™t enjoy owning it.
Iâ€™ll take a statue on a front lawn any day!

It looked great and I regret not buying it...
It was only $1200 iirc.

Edit: It was a small table top statute and this was over 10 years ago...

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]kernanb 2 points3 points4 points 1 hour ago (0 children)The house itself is great. The artist is Botero - I'm not a big fan, and this particular sculpture sticks out like a sore thumb next to this house. Something like a Rodin (The Thinker etc.) would have been more suitable.
