permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]StarsCanScream 96 points97 points98 points 2 hours ago (5 children)Bro gerrymandered the pizza

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]Salihe6677 6 points7 points8 points 56 minutes ago (1 child)Because the pepperoni is so evenly distributed, and all the slices are relatively similar in size, it kinda seems like the exact opposite of gerrymandering. 
Also, I feel like the pepperoni was moved around because every piece looks like it's just resting on the top, not attached at all. Plus, some of the pepperonis were clearly pushed judging from the push patterns along the edges with the cheese, and how much sauce is exposed. 
Course, I could be wrong, but smells suspish.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]h2d2[S] 0 points1 point2 points 5 minutes ago (0 children)This was a frozen cheese pizza with turkey pepperoni added on top... sometimes I scrape off a bit of the cheese first to have it on top of the pepperoni but this was the easier approach.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]JumboKraken 17 points18 points19 points 2 hours ago (9 children)You always use a knife to cut pizza. A pizza cutter is just a circular spinning knife

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]Keksverkaufer 8 points9 points10 points 2 hours ago (1 child)Some people use scissors, which, technically are just opposed knives, so you'd still be correct.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]StarsCanScream 96 points97 points98 points 2 hours ago (5 children)Bro gerrymandered the pizza

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]Salihe6677 6 points7 points8 points 56 minutes ago (1 child)Because the pepperoni is so evenly distributed, and all the slices are relatively similar in size, it kinda seems like the exact opposite of gerrymandering. 
Also, I feel like the pepperoni was moved around because every piece looks like it's just resting on the top, not attached at all. Plus, some of the pepperonis were clearly pushed judging from the push patterns along the edges with the cheese, and how much sauce is exposed. 
Course, I could be wrong, but smells suspish.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]h2d2[S] 0 points1 point2 points 5 minutes ago (0 children)This was a frozen cheese pizza with turkey pepperoni added on top... sometimes I scrape off a bit of the cheese first to have it on top of the pepperoni but this was the easier approach.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]JumboKraken 17 points18 points19 points 2 hours ago (9 children)You always use a knife to cut pizza. A pizza cutter is just a circular spinning knife

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]Keksverkaufer 8 points9 points10 points 2 hours ago (1 child)Some people use scissors, which, technically are just opposed knives, so you'd still be correct.
