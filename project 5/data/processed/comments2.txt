permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]StarsCanScream 96 points97 points98 points 2 hours ago (5 children)Bro gerrymandered the pizza

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]Salihe6677 6 points7 points8 points 56 minutes ago (1 child)Because the pepperoni is so evenly distributed, and all the slices are relatively similar in size, it kinda seems like the exact opposite of gerrymandering. 
Also, I feel like the pepperoni was moved around because every piece looks like it's just resting on the top, not attached at all. Plus, some of the pepperonis were clearly pushed judging from the push patterns along the edges with the cheese, and how much sauce is exposed. 
Course, I could be wrong, but smells suspish.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]h2d2[S] 0 points1 point2 points 5 minutes ago (0 children)This was a frozen cheese pizza with turkey pepperoni added on top... sometimes I scrape off a bit of the cheese first to have it on top of the pepperoni but this was the easier approach.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]JumboKraken 17 points18 points19 points 2 hours ago (9 children)You always use a knife to cut pizza. A pizza cutter is just a circular spinning knife

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]Keksverkaufer 8 points9 points10 points 2 hours ago (1 child)Some people use scissors, which, technically are just opposed knives, so you'd still be correct.

OP try a pizza mezzaluna if you make lots of pizza.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]StarsCanScream 96 points97 points98 points 2 hours ago (5 children)Bro gerrymandered the pizza

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]Salihe6677 6 points7 points8 points 56 minutes ago (1 child)Because the pepperoni is so evenly distributed, and all the slices are relatively similar in size, it kinda seems like the exact opposite of gerrymandering. 
Also, I feel like the pepperoni was moved around because every piece looks like it's just resting on the top, not attached at all. Plus, some of the pepperonis were clearly pushed judging from the push patterns along the edges with the cheese, and how much sauce is exposed. 
Course, I could be wrong, but smells suspish.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]h2d2[S] 0 points1 point2 points 5 minutes ago (0 children)This was a frozen cheese pizza with turkey pepperoni added on top... sometimes I scrape off a bit of the cheese first to have it on top of the pepperoni but this was the easier approach.

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]eblackham 20 points21 points22 points 4 hours ago (12 children)I know, who uses a knife to cut pizza?

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]JumboKraken 17 points18 points19 points 2 hours ago (9 children)You always use a knife to cut pizza. A pizza cutter is just a circular spinning knife

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]Keksverkaufer 8 points9 points10 points 2 hours ago (1 child)Some people use scissors, which, technically are just opposed knives, so you'd still be correct.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]yeahiateit 1 point2 points3 points 2 hours ago (3 children)Do you put your pizza cutter to a whetstone? Could you slice a falling piece of paper in two with it's sharpness?
OP try a pizza mezzaluna if you make lots of pizza.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]JumboKraken 1 point2 points3 points 2 hours ago (0 children)I personally donâ€™t sharpen my pizza cutter, but there is no reason you couldnâ€™t sharpen a pizza cutter on a whetstone

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]MrDjS[] 0 points1 point2 points 51 minutes ago (0 children)I googled to be sure because I didn't know what it was called, but I have a wooden mezzaluna, and it the by far the best and easiest way to cut a pizza.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]eloel- 1 point2 points3 points 1 hour ago (0 children)Unless teeth are "just biological knives", every pizza is also cut by teeth.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]PixelPervert 14 points15 points16 points 6 hours ago (2 children)You could have just arranged the pepperoni prior to cooking to avoid this monstrosity

Everybody was calling them crazy and I was feeling some type of way. But this isn't that wild. I like pepperoni in every bite too, gotta make it do what it do

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]PatchJacket 4 points5 points6 points 1 hour ago (1 child)It bothers me that all of the slices have 3 peps, aside from one with 2 and another with 4. If you moved a pep from the 4 to the 2, every slice would have 3 peps ðŸ˜­

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]illegalsmolcat -2 points-1 points0 points 56 minutes ago (3 children)Didn't say you stole the photo. I'm saying you stole the idea.
Someone posted that the father did this and blablabla.
I'm just pointing out that.
DOOOWN YOU GO.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]h2d2[S] -2 points-1 points0 points 54 minutes ago (2 children)Is it not possible for you that I never saw that post among the millions of reddit posts added everyday and thought of doing it on my own...?!?

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]illegalsmolcat -2 points-1 points0 points 37 minutes ago (1 child)Right. Sure. Haha.
