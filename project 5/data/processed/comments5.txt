permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]kiwilovenick 263 points264 points265 points 11 hours ago (13 children)I would love to see the inside setup of this. Sort of tiny home but made very inefficient by the round walls, I would imagine.

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]csawman95 99 points100 points101 points 6 hours ago (9 children)I actually live in a 25' diameter 2 story round house with my partner and 2 dogs. It's more efficient because of the round walls because there are no awkward corners to work around. The flow of the space is actually really good and it feels bigger than the equivalent sqft of a regular square house (moved here from a slightly larger apartment and i prefer this place way more(

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]pavlovachinquapin 88 points89 points90 points 4 hours ago (7 children)Sounds like a Roombaâ€™s dream.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]csawman95 68 points69 points70 points 3 hours ago (4 children)If by Roomba you mean senior dog with long claws slowly pacing in circles at 6 am on the wood floor, then yes. It is a dream indeed

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]pavlovachinquapin 17 points18 points19 points 3 hours ago (1 child)I could hear the claws as I read your comment. I imagine earplugs are a friend of yours.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]Sylphietteisbestgirl 70 points71 points72 points 9 hours ago (1 child)It's fucked up to not include photos of the inside.

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]TheRogueMoose 2 points3 points4 points 4 hours ago (0 children)Agreed, it's just a big tease!

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]GoodMerlinpeen 21 points22 points23 points 7 hours ago (0 children)I don't think it is the same structure, but this is a clip of a similar conversion including inside views - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7FD1IIi\_Uk

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]FROST0099 9 points10 points11 points 5 hours ago (0 children)what,  no inside pictures?

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]NoMoreOldCrutches 44 points45 points46 points 11 hours ago (2 children)I bet that thing's a bitch to heat AND cool.

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]csawman95 23 points24 points25 points 6 hours ago (0 children)I live in a round house similar size- it heats and cools better than anywhere I've ever lived because the air flows freely around the space. No corners for cool or warm air to settle in, and if you turn on a fan anywhere it affects the whole floor because of that

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]McLayan 33 points34 points35 points 7 hours ago (0 children)Depending on the insulation applied to the inside it could be easy to heat. And the round shape actually minimize the surface and could optimize heat spread depending in how it's heated and if there are inner walls.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]Wild_Animal99 7 points8 points9 points 10 hours ago (1 child)A little Spray foam insulation and that structure would be cozy in any climate.

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]DrEnter 1 point2 points3 points 46 minutes ago (0 children)A lot.  A lot of spray foam insulation.
I grew up on a farm and we had a few of these.  Thermally-speaking, those walls are... better than no walls... sometimes.
Don't forget a layer on that concrete floor as well.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]MFDOOM156 3 points4 points5 points 9 hours ago (0 children)I used to build grain bins, thatâ€™s cool bro ðŸ‘

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]meuserj 2 points3 points4 points 3 hours ago (0 children)I've worked inside a grain bin on hot summer days... I really hope they have good insulation on the inside and a great HVAC system.

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]zipzap21 1 point2 points3 points 11 hours ago (0 children)It's bin real.

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]SlaveDuck 1 point2 points3 points 10 hours ago (0 children)Do they still find the occasional bit of grain appearing by magic I wonder.

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]Fr000m 1 point2 points3 points 6 hours ago (0 children)It's not centered on the pad. OCD intensifies

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]chiefmud 1 point2 points3 points 4 hours ago (0 children)I think a Iâ€™ve seen this exact house, or something very similar. It was student housing for agriculture interns on a non-profit farm.

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]OhNoEnglandBloke 1 point2 points3 points 4 hours ago (0 children)I absolutely love this!!!!!!! 
Like I want it!

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]She_Plays 1 point2 points3 points 3 hours ago (0 children)Would love to know the cost of this project, and what the inside looks like!

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]Turbulent_Ad1921 1 point2 points3 points 3 hours ago (0 children)I Would love to see some photos of the inside!

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]HoodFellaz 1 point2 points3 points 3 hours ago (0 children)If there's no furnace and air conditioner, I'd put my in laws in there in a heartbeat 

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]Tough-Emu7127 -1 points0 points1 point 10 hours ago (1 child)For what purpose?

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]NeedsMoreEmu 0 points1 point2 points 2 hours ago (0 children)Probably a guest house.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]JCMarcus 0 points1 point2 points 5 hours ago (0 children)Nice.
If Apple can have a circular building why not us?

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]johnp299 0 points1 point2 points 4 hours ago (0 children)Yeah, but you can't tell your kid to go sit in the corner.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]ijozypheen 1 point2 points3 points 3 hours ago (0 children)I could imagine the residents dressing up this house for Halloween!

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]Sylphietteisbestgirl 70 points71 points72 points 9 hours ago (1 child)It's fucked up to not include photos of the inside.

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]TheRogueMoose 2 points3 points4 points 4 hours ago (0 children)Agreed, it's just a big tease!

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]GoodMerlinpeen 21 points22 points23 points 7 hours ago (0 children)I don't think it is the same structure, but this is a clip of a similar conversion including inside views - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7FD1IIi\_Uk

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]Space--Buckaroo 13 points14 points15 points 10 hours ago (0 children)Can't tell your kid to go stand in the corner.

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]FROST0099 9 points10 points11 points 5 hours ago (0 children)what,  no inside pictures?

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]NoMoreOldCrutches 44 points45 points46 points 11 hours ago (2 children)I bet that thing's a bitch to heat AND cool.

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]csawman95 23 points24 points25 points 6 hours ago (0 children)I live in a round house similar size- it heats and cools better than anywhere I've ever lived because the air flows freely around the space. No corners for cool or warm air to settle in, and if you turn on a fan anywhere it affects the whole floor because of that

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]McLayan 33 points34 points35 points 7 hours ago (0 children)Depending on the insulation applied to the inside it could be easy to heat. And the round shape actually minimize the surface and could optimize heat spread depending in how it's heated and if there are inner walls.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]Wild_Animal99 7 points8 points9 points 10 hours ago (1 child)A little Spray foam insulation and that structure would be cozy in any climate.

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]DrEnter 1 point2 points3 points 46 minutes ago (0 children)A lot.  A lot of spray foam insulation.
I grew up on a farm and we had a few of these.  Thermally-speaking, those walls are... better than no walls... sometimes.
Don't forget a layer on that concrete floor as well.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[â€“]MFDOOM156 3 points4 points5 points 9 hours ago (0 children)I used to build grain bins, thatâ€™s cool bro ðŸ‘

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]meuserj 2 points3 points4 points 3 hours ago (0 children)I've worked inside a grain bin on hot summer days... I really hope they have good insulation on the inside and a great HVAC system.

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]zipzap21 1 point2 points3 points 11 hours ago (0 children)It's bin real.

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]SlaveDuck 1 point2 points3 points 10 hours ago (0 children)Do they still find the occasional bit of grain appearing by magic I wonder.

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]Fr000m 1 point2 points3 points 6 hours ago (0 children)It's not centered on the pad. OCD intensifies

permalinkembedsavereportreply[â€“]chiefmud 1 point2 points3 points 4 hours ago (0 children)I think a Iâ€™ve seen this exact house, or something very similar. It was student housing for agriculture interns on a non-profit farm.
